# Chess Game Statistics Data Analysis

This project analyzes chess game data to uncover key statistics, trends, and insights into player performance, game outcomes, and strategic moves. Using data from online chess platforms, we processed and visualized various metrics to better understand factors influencing game results and player behavior.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: The dataset includes chess game details, such as player ratings, game duration, move sequences, and outcomes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning steps to handle missing values, standardize columns, and prepare for analysis.
- **Analysis and Visualization**:
  - **Win/Loss Analysis**: Distribution of wins, losses, and draws across different player ratings and time controls.
  - **Move Analysis**: Common opening moves and sequences correlated with game outcomes.
  - **Player Performance**: Trends in player ratings over time and performance consistency.
- **Modeling and Predictions**: Exploration of basic prediction models to estimate game outcomes based on player ratings, move counts, and time controls.

## Key Results

- Identified high-success openings and strategies correlated with different player levels.
- Analyzed player rating distributions and trends, revealing performance consistency across time controls.
- Developed visualizations to highlight strategic choices and their influence on game outcomes.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or later
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` (for basic predictive models)


## Future Improvements

- Add advanced machine learning models for more accurate game outcome predictions.
- Implement move-by-move analysis to evaluate strategic shifts during gameplay.
- Expand dataset for broader statistical analysis across different player demographics.
